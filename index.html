            <h2>Our history</h2>
            <p>
                For many years, Janey has been baking the most delicious pies at her home.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2013, we opened our first store in Dublin in a cosy little street
                near St. Stephen's Green. People from all over the world fell in love with the soft
                cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Janey's Pie Shop moved in to a larger
                building.  After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it 
                possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world.
                You are now looking at the result of this our very own online store, making it possible to order
                Janey's delicious pies whenever you feel like it.
            </p>
